Variously described by friends as "you know, that guy, the big one with the beard", "who?", "why the hell does he *know* that?", and (during a brief period of beardlessness) "you know, that guy, the big one without the beard", Jos Purvis has been garnering puzzled looks, epic side-eye, and the occasional elbow to the ribs since he was small. A lifetime spent entertaining the masses with his endless ability to fit his own foot in his mouth multiple times in a single conversation does not seem to have stemmed his enthusiasm for self-deprecation or his ability to start stories that absolutely no one will ask him to finish after being interrupted.

A late-stage addition to the ranks of the neurospicy, his ADHD diagnosis led to many rounds of "ohhh, yep, that explains a lot" among family, friends, and co-workers; tragically, it did not seem to lead to any improvement in his ability to retain Dad jokes and useless trivia for regurgitation at random, nor his ability to generate obscenely long run-on sentences.
