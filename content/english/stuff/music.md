## Ah, sweet music of life...

To balance out all my heavy left-brained work, I work/play as a performer, acting and singing for various shows and benefits. I actually started out to be a musician—even got a degree in it (B.A. Vocal Performance, UNC-Chapel Hill, 1998)—but got a little sidetracked into computing as a day job when I discovered how much I enjoyed that work too (and that whole "paying the bills" thing doesn't hurt either!).

## Taking the stage

Nowadays, most of my singing and acting is non-profit work, singing opera and musical theater with a variety of groups. Since I'm always looking for new places to sing and perform, I do leave my music resume online. Occasionally I get talked into performing onstage, or you can catch me at an open-mic like the Broadway-focused "Yonder" sessions in Hillsborough.
