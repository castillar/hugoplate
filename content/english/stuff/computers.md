The left-brain side of my personality is amply represented through my work in computers, both for fun (web design, diddling with graphics and photography, gaming) and profit (employment in systems administration, web administration, and computer security).

Copies of my resume are available for the asking; I keep an online version as well, although I'm not as aggressive about keeping it up to date. If you'd like a copy of my resume or references, just drop me a line and say so. As a summary, though, here's a quick rundown of my fun-and-games in computing.

## Computer Security

This is the bulk of my work in computing these days: after a long stretch of working for large corporations, I'm now happily back to working for a small company again. We're a content distribution network that tends to punch above our weight class in bandwidth and clientele; I head up our internal identity and access-management discipline. Having spent fifteen years working in PKI and cryptography, I do still manage to keep my toes in the water, though, by helping out with our new public-trusted certification authority and continuing to help represent us to the CA/Browser Forum.

## Systems Administration

This was how I got my start in IT, graduating from small-time web work to herding Sun/BSD/Linux boxen for various companies. Although it's not my primary job function anymore, I still enjoy managing a home lab both for work and pleasure, which includes a lot of Linux along with a smattering of FreeBSD, OS X, and the occasional Windows box.

## Web Design
Humble little sites like this one are a fun project for me, allowing me to bridge left-brain and right-brain activities. I've let on about being an IT guy at various points, such that I'm now the unofficial/official IT person for a couple local non-profit theatre companies. I've learned more about Wordpress than I ever cared to in the process, but it's still a fun gig.
