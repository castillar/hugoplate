After too much time with a hand-constructed site, I decided to swap over to a static site-generator to make life easier and perhaps facilitate more content production. The site is now produced using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a Go-based tool that flips my meanderings in Markdown into HTML pages while exposing enough of the underbelly of the page construction to allow me to tinker with it at will.

To make things look nicer, I started with [Zeon Studio's](https://zeon.studio/) [hugoplate](https://github.com/zeon-studio/hugoplate) theme as a base. It uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), which makes adjusting colors, layouts, and features immensely easier by abstracting everything into a collection of CSS classes. I definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys tinkering with layouts but hates trying to remember how to construct a flexbox layout or apply consistent color schemes.

For typography, I'm using [Cormorant Garamond](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/cormorant) for the headers and [Sofia Sans Semi-Condensed](https://github.com/lettersoup/Sofia-Sans) for the bodies. I opted to self-host both of them because Google gets way too much of the world's traffic as it is.
