Between photography and recording, I have a strange fascination with capturing things as they are, or were. I love looking at photos (or listening to recordings) and imagining what was happening when they were taken, which drove me to start taking photos and to colorizing old photos. I had some examples up, but I haven't put them back online after moving this site around â€” meantime, my Flickr feed is linked below.
